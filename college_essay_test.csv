Olem,On the surface I think I am like most young and modern American women: I take school seriously I have dreams and goals for the future that I am determined to make happen and I don_t expect anyone to do the hard work for me. I come from what is an increasingly normal background: my parents are divorced and I live with my mom and sisters and only occasionally see my dad since he now lives on the other side of the country but I still feel very lucky to have a supportive if spread out family behind me. What makes me different from the rest of the crowd though is how I choose to fill my time away from school. I come from a middle income background so I knew I_d have to get a job in the summers and/or after school to help fund college but instead of getting the easiest job I could find like many of my friends I purposely sought work that would teach me new skills as well as give me a sense of fulfillment which is why I turned to coaching soccer and working as a camp counselor. I know that every summer I am out there I_m helping the kids in my community not only by watching to make sure they are playing with skill and determination but also by helping them learn invaluable life lessons like how to be a good teammate and friend and how to settle disputes fairly and efficiently. I also have now added the title of waitress to my resume and while at first glance this job may not seem to offer me skills useful in pursuing a college degree I have found it to offer incomparable training in multi-tasking responsibility money-management perseverance and compassion for others. My grades have always been high and I am especially proud of this because I don_t naturally excel in all subjects. Writing has always been a challenge for me because I find grammar to often be confusing spelling too but I have learned through my involvement with many varsity level sports that quitting never feels as good as conquering your own fears which is why I have sought not only advanced placement writing classes to really help me focus on mastering the written word but I have also challenged myself to take advanced placement Greek which while very difficult has helped me immensely with learning word origins giving me the foundations to figure out challenging words in English as well. I am now on the cusp of attending college and preparing for a career and I am confident that the determination I have displayed thus far will only grow stronger as my course work becomes more demanding. At this point I think I want to focus on a career in the law because the riddle of our legal system fascinates me and I really believe that coming from a divorced household myself I could offer empathetic legal counsel to others facing the ordeal of family court. I know that I am young and the career path I find myself on after earning an undergraduate degree may be very different than what I envision now but I plan to make my college education a well rounded and broadening one that hopefully will allow me to explore both my academic and artistic interests so that wherever the future takes me I will have a solid foundation upon which to build a career.
Ryley,Sometimes a task can seem monumental when you try to visualize the entire thing but if you break it down into smaller goals suddenly it can become manageable. When I first started to consider going to college so that I could make a better life for myself and my daughter I thought it was going to be almost impossible. I was working in a convenience store trying to make ends meet as a single mother but I just knew that there was something more out there for me. I had the drive to build a career that did not involve running credit cards through the machine and cleaning the public bathroom I just needed the skills and the opportunity to determine what that other dream job was. It can be difficult to leave what is familiar and I actually really liked the people who owned the convenience store and knew that they would be sad to see me go but it was time to strike out on my own. I set a goal of successfully finishing one semester at my local junior college just to see if I could manage it and much to my delight I not only completed the semester but earned a place on the Dean_s List as well. I felt a tremendous amount of pride in this accomplishment and it certainly wasn_t easy but it helped to give me the confidence I needed to set longer term goals. I found that I was very interested in the sciences and how the human body works. I am now about to graduate with my Associate_s of Science degree having maintained my position on the Dean_s List the entire time and I finally know that I am setting the kind of example for my daughter that I always dreamed of when I was wringing out the mop and restocking the shelves at the convenience store. I am now eager to take my education to the next level by pursuing a degree in nursing at ____ University. It is my goal after graduating to become a nurse serving lower income and underrepresented communities. I am a naturally compassionate person and because of my lower socio-economic background and life experience I can relate easily to people who may fear going to see medical professionals whom they perceive as different from them but whose services they need. I can help bridge that gap and thereby encourage more people to actually get help that they require in a comforting and non-threatening environment. My commitment to my education is strong and I know that if admitted I will be able to earn a solid grade point average and graduate with the skills and experience I will need to build my career as a nurse. I feel such relief and gratitude to know that I have found my calling and I am eager to begin this new stage of my education. Certainly the next two years will be challenging_requiring much juggling of schedules and time management expertise--but I have done it before and with my clear goal in my mind I know I can do it again with equal or greater success. Even though my commitment to my education takes some time away from my child I know that ultimately it will be worth the sacrifice because she will see how important an education is by witnessing all I have given up to achieve mine and what a strong career I will be able to build because of those same sacrifices.
Iris,Cross-country running a sport that requires the fusing of body and mind strives to maximize your physical ability by testing your mental tenacity. Everyday represents a new struggle to beat yesterdays maximum output an issue of mind over matter. I have known the agony of this conflict since I joined the newly established cross-country team. As convincing as my morning doubts are I do not heed them. Through pains and sprains and through adverse weather and unfavorable conditions I run because I made up my mind three years ago to succeed. With amenities such as cars and buses I have no pragmatic reason to use my feet especially if I lack a destination. I do not run to the gym to acquire a stylish figure for my slender frame does not require it. And this grueling run differs from a relaxing jog to a coffee shop. I am pushing myself constantly to run faster and farther for my team as well as for personal glory. Somehow with tireless effort and unflagging commitment I run through the sleeping streets of my neighborhood with the awareness that I am steadily reaching my goal-maintaining the discipline that cross-country demands. In my mind I see a victory line that symbolizes the results of perseverance and hard work. This line makes me realize that ambition and tenacity do not go in vain. And it constantly reminds me that all those mornings in which I struggled to leave my cozy cocoon have allowed me to fly. While the world slept I Jane Smith was awake and working hard to attain my goal. I feel more confident now that on the road of life when others may be walking I will be running. I will run through ankle injuries and through fatigue. I will endure the inevitable hills and valleys. I will endure and I will achieve.
Quan,JOLT an outreach program runs an annual overnight summer camp in Ukraine with counselors from the United States and Israel. These counselors are carefully selected because of the rigorous programming and the many physical hardships of living in Ukraine. Over one hundred local children come to Charkov to learn about their Jewish background. As one of the counselors I had the privilege and extraordinary task of exposing them to the beauty of our religion and heritage. I remember the anxiety and excitement that I felt as I exited the plane with twenty other high school students embarking on my summer teaching experience wondering if I was fully prepared. The moment the busloads of children arrived I attached myself to a group of kids and started singing and dancing with them. Despite my initial fears we began to form a bond. My role changed from that of a teenager to that of a responsible counselor. Not only was I here to teach them about Judaism through classes and activities but more importantly I was acting as a role model. For the majority of Ukrainian children we were the first Americans they had ever met and therefore were watched vigilantly and constantly emulated. This humbling realization made me feel rather self-conscious at first. However their desire to imitate also heightened the impact of that which we taught them. They wanted to learn. Although an immense language barrier lay between the campers and me we managed to communicate through translators hand signals songs and broken English and Russian. With the help of a book that contained both the Hebrew and Russian I taught Hebrew to a group of ten children who had never before been exposed to Judaism. Glieb a ten-year old boy rapidly rose to the top of the class. In addition to the mandatory hours of daily learning he was motivated to extend these sessions. So often at night after the fun and entertainment he and I would practice reading Hebrew and we discussed in simple terms aspects of Jewish ritual that fascinated him. It was with Glieb that I formed the deepest bond one that relied not only on talking for he spoke only a minimal amount of English but rather on demonstrating our fondness through actions. A few days before the end of camp in broken English Glieb explained that he had been working endlessly on a present for me. Similarly I had been trying to decide on something that I could give him. After hours of pondering I decided to give Glieb what was most dear to me my siddur(prayer book) which I had received upon entering sixth grade. I felt it appropriate to present him with his very first prayer book. For hours I decorated and transliterated the main prayers and on the last day of camp before the kids left we exchanged presents.
Lina,This past summer as I looked around the yard at the beaming faces flushed from dancing I realized that Camp Glitter Girls was the culmination of all the experiences and lessons in which I partook since my first camp four years earlier. I learned how to make a camp with ten campers far more fun and even more profitable than a camp for thirty-five children. Instead of marketing to a broad range of ages I marketed Camp Glitter Girls to a specific age group of girls. The smaller group facilitated a close and familiar atmosphere not to mention a decrease in problems. Instead of focusing on the quantity of campers I focused on the quality of my campers experience and we all reaped the benefits. The mock wedding at my previous camps never exuded the energy and spirit of the one at Camp Glitter Girls. As the dancing subsided and I heard oohs and aahs over the cake I looked at every single girl in the room. I did not just see cute adorable faces; rather I saw how each girl challenged me in her own way and unconsciously taught me her own special lesson. As I turn towards my future and make life-defining decisions I look back upon my experiences with my campers for inspiration and direction. I view my upcoming years at university as an opportunity to further use the skills I acquired in running summer camps. The diversity academic excellence and broad array of classes and extracurricular activities at UCLA will provide an environment that will challenge me to use the leadership initiative creativity and interpersonal abilities that I used at Camp Glitter Girls.
Grant,Hours after Lauren_s birth on a snowy February day my dad took me to the hospital to meet her. I insisted on wearing my souvenir Burger King crown because I liked it and thought that she_d like it too! Amid all the fanfare and excitement somehow there was a special gift from Lauren to me: a shiny red fire truck! As I opened my gift I wondered how she could have known that trucks were among my favorite toys (although I didn_t ponder that too long). Daily life quickly changed for me in ways I hadn_t imagined. Initially my big-brother role was mostly that of helpful assistant who dutifully gave her a bottle or held her. After I had been assisting with her physical care for some time I volunteered more meaningful contributions such as encouraging her to crawl and walk. To my surprise I secretly started to enjoy my new role. I was getting unexpected pleasure from my increasing responsibilities and from my rising family status. No longer was I simply the older brother; now I was also her close friend teacher and coach. Her respect for me made (and makes) me feel more mature capable adult-like. I treat her questions seriously and trust that she finds the lessons I teach her from my experience helpful and relevant. I welcome the opportunity to mentor her and she shows me her appreciation.
James,Laura was my dad_s first girlfriend after my parents_ divorce. The first three years of our relationship were characterized solely by my hatred toward her manifested in my hurting her each moment hurting myself twice as much. From the moment I laid eyes on her she was the object of my unabated hatred not because of anything she had ever done but because of everything she represented. I judged her to be a heartless soulless two-dimensional figure: she was a representation of my loneliness and pain. I left whenever she entered a room I slammed car doors in her face. Over those three years I took pride in the fact that I had not spoken a word to her or made eye contact with her. I treated Laura with such resentment and anger because my hate was my protection my shield. I accustomed to viewing her as the embodiment of my pain was afraid to let go of the anger and hate afraid to love the person who allowed me to hold onto my anger afraid that if I gave her a chance I might love her. For those three years Laura didn_t hate me; she understood me. She understood my anger and my confusion and Laura put her faith in me although she had every reason not to. To her I was essentially a good person just confused and scared; trying to do her best but just not able to get a hold of herself. She saw me as I wished I could see myself. None of this became clear to me overnight. Instead over the next two years the one-dimensional image of her in my mind began to take the shape of a person. As I let go of my hatred I gave her a chance. She became a woman who like me loves Ally McBeal and drinks a lot of coffee; who unlike me buys things advertised on infomercials. Three weeks ago I saw that same Mother Teresa quote again but this time I smiled. Laura never gave up on me and the chance she gave me to like her was a chance that changed my life. Because of this I know the value of a chance of having faith in a person of seeing others as they wish they could see themselves. I_m glad I have a lot of time left because I definitely have a lot of chances left to give a lot of people left to love.
Sinnie,Throughout pre-season we worked hard despite our lack of attention from everyone. In our first scrimmage we defeated the other team but that_s not how I remember that day. Right after I played I found out that my cousin had been killed in a car accident. My family was devastated and the next few weeks would be extremely hard. Somehow soccer kept my spirits high. It gave me a chance to get my mind off the tragic things that were going on around me. The day of his funeral I played my heart out in our first game and even made an assist. Things were looking up. We managed to stay .500 throughout the first couple of weeks. One day the rain forced us to practice inside the gym which can be very dangerous for soccer players. In a drill I put too much pressure on my foot and I heard something crack. Thankfully practice was almost over and I was able to hide my agony from my coaches. The next day my foot was so swollen and in so much pain that it hurt to just walk. In the coming weeks I endured more pain than I ever had before. But I did not want to stop playing no matter what. I pressed on despite the awful aching and later I would be grateful that I did. We barely got into the playoffs but we surprisingly won the semi-finals to upset the number one seeded team. The day of the Section 9 title game I still couldn_t believe we had made it this far. I had a doctor_s appointment that morning for my injured foot and my doctor tried to bring an early end to my season by convincing me it was too dangerous to play. Nobody could keep me from playing that game. The stadium was packed with people to watch us play that night and it was clear to us that the other team was the local pick. Adrenaline rushed through me as we went through our warm up. As I stepped on the field I realized that this was probably the biggest game that I would ever play in. When the match started I went out to do my job for the game: make sure number 23 barely touched the ball and stop her from scoring. I can_t say it was easy but I defended the section_s leading scorer the whole game. She didn_t touch the ball more than once throughout the whole eighty minutes of play. We would go on to defeat the other team 4-1 and I played one of the best games of my life. When the final whistle blew time stopped as we celebrated a win I never thought was possible. Despite my grief and painful injury I had helped my team exceed everyone_s expectations. Fighting through all of my challenges was hard but that moment made up for all of the sacrifices and I had never felt so proud.
Frederique,In my life I have taken many journeys without which I would not have experienced important truths. My father started us off early taking us on many journeys to help us understand that true knowledge comes only from experience. We took trips every winter break to Madrid Mexico Costa Rica and to Jamaica and Trinidad my parents_ homeland for Christmas. Silly things I remember from those trips include the mango chili sauce on the pork in Maui the names of the women who gave out the towels by the pools in Selva Verde Costa Rica eating dinner at 10 p.m. in Spain. These were all tourist experiences that I at first found spellbinding. My truths were the truths of the tourist brochures: beautiful hotels beaches and cities. I did not see the blindfolds. I did not appreciate how being held hostage by the beauty of the surface_the beaches and cities_blinded me to the absence of Puerto Rican natives on the streets of San Juan; I did not understand how the prevalence and familiarity of English conspired to veil the beauty of the Spanish language beneath volumes of English translations. I learned more about these truths in my sophomore year of high school when I was among a group of students selected to visit Cuba. My grandmother was born in Cuba yet I had never thought to research my own heritage. I have remained the na_ve American who saw Castro as some distant enemy of my country accepting this as fact because this seemed to be the accepted wisdom. I soon became intrigued however with this supposed plague to my freedom my culture and everything good and decent. I began to think just what is communism anyway? What_s so bad about Castro and Cuba_and I hear they have good coffee. I believed that what was missing was a lack of understanding between our two cultures and that acceptance of our differences would come only with knowledge. My first impression of Cuba was the absence of commercialism. I saw no giant golden arch enticing hungry Cubans with beef-laced fries; I did see billboards of Che Guevara and signposts exhorting unity and love. I realized however that much of the uniqueness that I relished here might be gone if the trade blockades in Cuba were ever lifted. The parallels and the irony were not lost on me. I was stepping out of an American political cave that shrouded the beauty of Cuba and stepping into another one built on patriotic socialism one where truths were just as ideological as yet very different from mine. History I recognized is never objective. The journeys I have taken have been colored by my prior experiences and by what my feelings were in those moments. Everyone holds a piece of the truth. Maybe facts don_t matter. Perhaps my experience is my truth and the more truths I hear from everyone else the closer I will get to harmonization. Maybe there is no harmony and I must go through life challenging and being challenged perhaps finding perspectives from which I can extract_but never call_truth. I must simply find ways to understand others to seek in them what is common to us all and perhaps someday find unity in our common human bond. This is what life has taught me so far my sum of truths gleaned from experiencing many cultures. I don_t know if these truths will hold but I hope that my college experience will be like my trip to Cuba_challenging some truths strengthening others and helping me experience new ones.
Aurora,Psst! I have a confession to make. I have a shoe fetish. Everyone around me seems to underestimate the statement a simple pair of shoes can make. To me though the shoes I wear are not merely covering for the two feet on which I tread but a reflection of who I am. So who am I? Why don_t you look down at my feet? I could be wearing my high-platform sandals_my confidence my leadership my I-want-to-be-tall-even-though-I_m-not shoes. My toes are free in these sandals and wiggle at will. Much like my feet in my sandals I don_t like being restricted. I have boundless energy that must not go to waste! Or maybe I_m wearing my furry pink pig slippers. I wear these on crisp winter nights when I_m home spending time with my family. My slippers are my comforting side. I can wear them and listen to a friend cry for hours on end. My favorite pair of shoes however are my bright red Dr. Martens. They_re my individuality my enthusiasm my laughter my love of risk-taking. No one else I know has them. When I don_t feel like drawing attention to my feet or for that matter to myself I wear my gym shoes. These sneakers render me indistinguishable from others and thereby allow me to be independent. I wear them running riding my bicycle alone through the trails surrounded by signs of autumn and even when I go to a museum and stand transfixed by a single photograph. My hiking boots typify my love of adventure and being outdoors. Broken in and molded to the shape of my foot when wearing them I feel in touch with my surroundings. During college I intend to add to my collection yet another closet full of colorful clodhoppers. For each aspect of my personality I discover or enhance through my college experiences I will find a pair of shoes to reflect it. Perhaps a pair of Naot sandals for my Jewish Studies class or one black shoe and one white when learning about the Chinese culture and its belief in yin and yang. As I get to know myself and my goals grow nearer my collection will expand. By the time I_m through with college I will be ready to take a big step. Ready for a change I believe I_ll need only one pair after this point. The shoes will be both fun and comfortable; I_ll be able to wear them when I am at work and when I return home. A combination of every shoe in my collection these shoes will embody each aspect of my personality in a single footstep. No longer will I have a separate pair for each quirk and quality. This one pair will say it all. It will be evidence of my self-awareness and maturity. Sure I_ll keep a few favorites for old times_ sake. I_ll lace up the old red shoes when I_m feeling rambunctious when I feel that familiar teenage surge of energy and remember the girl who wore them: a young girl with the potential to grow.
Monty,In the near future I will be closing the high school chapter of my life and opening a new one college! Everyone_s idea about their perfect college experience is different from the next and I have a clear idea of what college will be like for me and what I am hoping to accomplish. I envision in my academics great professors who will be willing to help me along my journey but also push me to the limit so that I can learn as much as possible. Through the years some of my favorite teachers have been the ones who have challenged me and moved me out of my comfort zone so that I can achieve more than I thought possible. For example I have at times struggled in English so my teachers have taught me to not give up but keep trying harder. Though I will never be an expert on the subject I have improved greatly and with the help of my past present and future teachers I will continue to work hard and achieve success in not only English but all other classes too. I also envision that as I gain more knowledge from my professors I will be able to pass that wisdom on to underclassmen by mentoring or tutoring them. I assist people now through volunteering at a local retirement community and feel that those experiences will help me continue to helping others in the future. I take great pride in what I do which is making peoples lives a little bit better on any given day. The feeling I get after knowing I did a good deed like volunteering is better than anything in the world and I would like to continue that in college. Socially I hope to join many clubs like: IWU Dance Team Residence Hall Association and a service group. I chose these extracurricular activities because they define who I am and what I am hoping to accomplish in college. All of these clubs in some way are already a part of who I am. They will enrich my life through helping others and the variety of friendships that I will be able to build. By joining these clubs I will put myself into a leadership role and I will be able to change the community for the better of the campus. With my addition to these clubs the school will benefit from my excellent work ethic as I give one hundred percent to everything I do. I hope to make many friends that will last a life time through my academics and also through my social life because I believe that friendship is more important than any materialistic item. Although this is personally what I think my college experience will be like I am anxious to see if my dreams hold true. Working hard in the classroom as well as socially will help me achieve these accomplishments while I am in college. I hope to be on the Illinois Wesleyan dance team because dance is my biggest passion and I plan to continue pursuing it in college. Dance keeps me physically and mentally fit by making me physically exercise but it also exercises my mind through having to memorize routines. This memorization process also helps me in academic classes because it is easier to memorize necessary facts. Ultimately I hope to achieve a spot on the IWU dance team. At some stage in my four years I wish to do a study abroad program during one of my May terms. This will allow me to expand my horizons by learning and becoming part of a completely different culture which will make me a well-rounded individual. I believe it would be fascinating to live in a different place for a period of time like Italy Australia or Spain. While I hope to achieve all my dreams my biggest goal is to maintain a GPA of 3.5 or higher in college so that I can go on to dental school. In order to complete this goal I hope to be a part of the biology academic honor society so that I can prove to myself that I can take on dental school. I will achieve this goal through dedicated studying to be successful in every class not just my major. This is very important to me because if I don_t work hard and be the top of the class I will not be able to pass the DAT. In conclusion I hope my ideal experiences and my personal accomplishments can be met. But I know that the only person that can make or break my future is me and I work extremely hard at what I truly want and the first step to that is turning Titan.
Iggy,Existentialist: Speaking of which I_ve been meaning to ask all of you: college? Honestly is it worth it? You . . . (gestures toward Logical) you_re writing that philosophy book which should do well. And look at Artsy over there! He_s composing music making beautiful art; why don_t we see where we can get with that? Not to mention the endless possibilities if Lighthearted aims for Saturday Night Live. Think about the number of successful people in this world who didn_t go to college! (Logical shakes his head) I mean let_s be realistic: if we go to college eventually we_ll be required to declare a major. Once we earn a degree it might be harder to pursue our true passions_comedy music art . . . Logical: Not true. First of all you failed to mention my fascinations with neurology and psychology which are potential majors at every university. Furthermore opportunities to study comedy music and art are available at all colleges too; we just have to go after them. (Sends a reassuring nod toward Artistic) In fact if anything college will facilitate our involvement in activities like drawing improvisational comedy piano psychological experiments Japanese ping-pong . . . Artistic: Yeah_imagine how much better I_d be at writing music if I took a music-composition course. Logical: Exactly. And what about our other educational goals such as becoming fluent in Japanese learning the use of every TI-89 calculator button . . . Independent: I agree. Plus I was thinking of college as a social clean slate. I am looking forward to living on my own_away from our overprotective over-scrutinizing family. No more hesitating to ask girls out! Lighthearted: (He has not been paying attention to the discussion) What ever happened to Captain Planet? He was like really popular in 1987 and then . . . Stressed: Enough out of you. (Lighthearted makes a mocking face at Stressed) You_re giving me a headache. By the way everyone we_re not making much progress here and I_m beginning to feel a stress-pimple coming on. (All except Existential gather around Stressed and comfort him) Existential: There_s really no reason to be stressed about anything. If you think about how trivial_how meaningless_all this worry is it_s kind of pathetic that your anxiety is about to get us all stuck with a pimple. Independent: I don_t know what you_re talking about Mr. I-Know-Everything-And-It-All-Means-Nothing but mightn_t we as well calm down Stressed? Existential: If you consider that your top priority right now. I thought we came here to do something else. Stressed: He_s right I_m fine. Let_s just get back to work and the problem will heal itself. Where were we?
